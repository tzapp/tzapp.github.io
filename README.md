Currently, all the game data is get on [this awesome FAQ](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/939426-final-fantasy-xii-international-zodiac-job-system/faqs/49691). 

All the data will be converted to JSON and texts will be on markdown style.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Tasks
